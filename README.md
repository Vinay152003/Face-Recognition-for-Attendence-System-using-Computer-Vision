# Face-Recognition-for-Attendence-System-using-Computer-Vision
A Face Recognition Attendance System using Computer Vision is a system that automates the process of taking attendance by recognizing individuals through their facial features.

Technologies and Libraries:
-Face Detection: OpenCV, Dlib, MTCNN
-Face Recognition: Face_recognition, OpenFace, FaceNet
-Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
-Web Frameworks: Django for building web-based interfaces

Challenges:
-Lighting and Angles: Ensure robustness against varying lighting conditions and facial angles.
-Privacy: Handle data with care, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
-Accuracy: Fine-tune the model to minimize false positives and negatives.
